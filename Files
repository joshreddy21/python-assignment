*************** 1. Write a program to read text file*******
# Read text file
file_path = 'example.txt'
with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

********2. Write a program to write text to .txt file using InputStream******************
# Write text to .txt file using OutputStream
file_path = 'output.txt'
text_to_write = "Hello, this is a test."
with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
    file.write(text_to_write)

***************3. Write a program to read a file stream**************
# Read a file stream
file_path = 'example.txt'
with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
    stream = file.read()
    print(stream)

**************4. Write a program to read a file stream supports random access*************
# Read a file stream supports random access
file_path = 'example.txt'
with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
    stream = file.read(10)  # Read the first 10 bytes
    print(stream)

*********5. Write a program to read a file a just to a particular index using seek()**************
# Read a file and adjust to a particular index using seek()
file_path = 'example.txt'
with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
    file.seek(5)  # Move to the 6th byte
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

***********6. Write a program to check whether a file is having read access and write access permissions***********import os

# Check whether a file has read and write access permissions
file_path = 'example.txt'

# Check read access
read_access = os.access(file_path, os.R_OK)
print(f"Read Access: {read_access}")

# Check write access
write_access = os.access(file_path, os.W_OK)
print(f"Write Access: {write_access}")
